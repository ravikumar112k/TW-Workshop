# TW Workshop

## 📌 Overview
TW Workshop is a **Streamlit-based learning management and training platform** designed for workshops.  
It provides role-specific dashboards for **Admins, Staff, and Students** to manage courses, tests, and user data efficiently.

## 🚀 Features
- **Admin Dashboard** (`admin_dashboard.py`): Manage courses, users, and platform settings.
- **Staff Dashboard** (`staff_dashboard.py`): Track student progress and manage uploaded content.
- **Student Access** (`Signup_Login.py`, `coursepage.py`): Students can sign up, log in, and access course materials.
- **Database Support**: Uses SQLite (`users.db`, `catalog.db`) for user and course data.
- **Environment Variables**: `.env` file for secure configuration management.
- **Sample Data Setup**: Scripts like `setup_db.py`, `setup_students.py`, and `insert_samples.py` help initialize the database with test data.
